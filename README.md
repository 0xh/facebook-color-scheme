# Facebook Color Scheme

Originally based on Facebook's 2012 iOS app, this theme features Facebook's typical washed up blues and pastels. Some colors were later highlighted, resulting in a more vibrant and technical look.

## Remarks

* Use with [Blackbird](https://github.com/mbixby/blackbird) for Sublime. Blackbird also includes packages for Markdown and Coffeescript with better support for this color scheme

* In modern typography, various features are used to improve readibility of your documents. In addition to different colors, you are provided with different sizes of fonts, weights, italics, kerned-type, leading or paragraph-specific leading. In lack of software with such features, try Sublime with Monaco Lives font at 13 - 14 px (part of Blackbird).

* Code that smells nice is a code that looks nice.

* For a lighter look, try [Bluebird](https://github.com/mbixby/bluebird) & [Github](https://github.com/mbixby/github-color-scheme) theme.
